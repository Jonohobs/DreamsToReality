## The Ralph Method

1. **Ask a focused question** to the AI
2. **Get the response** and extract key info
3. **Kill the context** (start fresh session)
4. **Route to someone else** or a different model for verification
5. **Iterate** until confident

**Why it works**: Prevents context pollution, gets fresh perspectives, catches hallucinations.
